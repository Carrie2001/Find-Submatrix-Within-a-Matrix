# Find-Submatrix-Within-a-Matrix

Description: This program searches a large matrix to find occurances of a smaller submatrix. It will return a count of the number of times that the submatrix appears in the matrix, and a list of x and y coordinates of where the submatrix can be found.<br>
<----------------------------------------------------------------------------><br>
1.The program3_demo will create three matrices: a numerical, character, and a logical matrix. The numerical and logical matrices are randomly generated. Each matrix will be presented to the user one at a time.<br>
2. The program asks the user to create a submatrix to look for. The user will enter the number of rows and columns desired. Then the user will populate the submatrix.<br>
3. The program will then display the number of times that the submatrix appears in the matrix, and it will display the x and y coordiantes where the upper-left element of the submatrix can be found within the matrix.
